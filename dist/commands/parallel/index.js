Task: ${task}

Please help me:
1. Break this task into independent subtasks that can run in parallel
2. Suggest which specific swarm agents from the agent-swarm library would be best suited for each subtask (consider agents like: product-manager, engineer, qa-tester, security-reviewer, docs-writer, etc.)
3. Explain the dependencies between subtasks (what must run first vs. what can run in parallel)
4. Provide a concrete execution plan showing the parallel execution order
5. Estimate the efficiency gain from parallelization vs sequential execution

Format as a clear execution plan with agent assignments.`,
